# Developer Status
This is up-2-date state of my programming activities as time goes by ! \
This page overrides what I stated in [CAREER UPDATE INFO](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p5swgfz2asoksjx/GA.localhost_version.v24.zip?dl=0&file_subpath=%2FGA.localhost_version%2F____CAREER+UPDATE+INFO____.txt "Dropbox's GA.localhost_version.v24").

### Angelica asked me to quit programming after completion of M-2022 Web Development and I said "Agree".
### Angelica asked me to complete M-2022 Web Development as soon as possible and I said "Agree".

#### Full stop.

Together we have decided, that the best option will be to implement all of M-2022 Web Development until the end of this year, converting it to something called M-2020 Web Development.

Therefore since yesterday, i.e. 06-March-2020 I have resumed M-2022 Web Development converting it to \
M-2020 Web Development.\
Current development progress is constantly being updated in the proper repos of the only valid place in my context, which is this GitHub account called *C4B-Solutions-Lab*.

Hence, since 01-January-2021 I will no longer be an active software engineer, and you will no longer be allowed to call me this way. \
You will be permitted to call me *former software engineer* instead.
