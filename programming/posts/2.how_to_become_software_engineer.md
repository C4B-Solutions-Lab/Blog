# Developer Career
If you really think about succeeding in programming, being a good developer preferebly software engineer in the future as I understand, requires following some good so-called patterns or good practices ! üòÄ

For all people there is a good path to follow, not my path, but the path I took on back in 2007 ! \
Follow these "rules" and you will succeed for sure in the future ! üòÄ
 - read at least 3 books on the subject
 - read some articles or try to read some of the best articles on weekly basis
 - read some good websites about programming language of your choice - where you can learn basics of the programming
 - practise the skills or learnt features by writing simple examples in your favorite IDE
 - **apply the 4 above rules** for the next 10 years or something like that. \
   Really ! (otherwise forget about being a good developer !) üëç

#### Regarding C#-oriented devs here are the resources (in the random order) I was using to learn programming over those years :
 - [Code Project](https://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/ "For those who code")
 - [C# Corner](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/ "Community of Software and Data Developers")
 - [C# 411](http://www.csharp411.com/ "Blog written by Tim Toady about the C# programming language and .NET Framework")
 - [Dot Net Perls](https://www.dotnetperls.com/ "Dot Net Perls has example pages for many languages, with explanations and code side by side (for easy understanding)")
